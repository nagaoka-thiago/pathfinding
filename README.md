# Pathfinding visualizer
The following pathfinding algorithms were implemented to be visualized:
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Greedy Search
- A*

The solution proposed in this project was to execute these algorithms using ReactJS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was based on the Pathfinding Visualizer implemented by Cl√©ment Mihailescu, which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak.

My version is hosted on Heroku at this link: https://nagaoka-pathfinding-visualizer.herokuapp.com/

## Download and run in your computer

npm start
```

## Using the visualizer
Here is an example of execution of A* algorithm:

Making walls is not hard, you need to click on the cell. The result is as the following image:
